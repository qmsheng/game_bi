    <!-- Include CSS to eliminate any default margins/padding and set the height of the html element and
         the body element to 100%, because Firefox, or any Gecko based browser, interprets percentage as
         the percentage of the height of its parent container, which has to be set explicitly.  Fix for
         Firefox 3.6 focus border issues.  Initially, don't display flashContent div so it won't show
         if JavaScript disabled.
